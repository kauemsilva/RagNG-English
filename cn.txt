	["Dialogue4002901"]= "唔……看来野生的大嘴鸟的驯化还不太靠谱呢……",
	["Dialogue4002902"]= "啊，欢迎。最近我委托了好多冒险者去治一治那些桀骜不驯的大嘴鸟，然后都被打得满头包回来。你要不要去试试看？",
	["Dialogue4002903"]= "是啊，别看驯化的大嘴鸟很可爱，野生的它们可狂暴了！可别小看它们了！",
	["Dialogue4003001"]= "沙漠……原来沙漠的真实面目是这样吗？",
	["Dialogue4003002"]= "我原本以为沙漠是寂静而空灵的，没想到却充满着喧嚣和狂野。为什么重金属蝗虫和沙漠契合得如此完美！冒险者，快去让它们安静下来！这不是我心目中的沙漠！",
	["Dialogue4003101"]= "情况真是越来越严峻了……",
	["Dialogue4003102"]= "蚂蚁们并没有理会我们的警告，反而变本加厉地开始袭击人类。不同于先前的白蚁，我们面对的是它们战斗能力更强的那些。",
	["Dialogue4003103"]= "先不要轻举妄动。它们的扩张离不开工蚁，工蚁的损失也能对它们造成巨大的影响。小心绕开战斗部队，瞄准羸弱的工蚁，一击致命！",
	["Dialogue4003201"]= "这些拦路的石头……",
	["Dialogue4003202"]= "就是那些巨石怪。虽然是一些没有什么攻击性的胆小鬼，但非常不巧的是，它们挡住了商团的行进路线。",

	["Dialogue4003502"]= "你知道沙漠之狼吗？它们的幼崽要么被抓去收集毛皮，要么就驯化成为宠物……它们对人类的憎恶已经到了无以复加的地步。不过换做是我的话，我也会满怀憎恨吧……",

	["Dialogue4003702"]= "对对，准确来说，是九条尾巴的狐狸。它们在斐扬的文化中代表的是吉祥，但金字塔里这些怎么看都散发着一股不详的气息嘛……",
	["Dialogue4003703"]= "一定就是它们的存在让我的运气变差的！冒险者，快去打倒它们！",

	["Dialogue4050201"]= "哈哈！多亏了你的活跃！我们的货物已经到咯！干得漂亮！下次要是它们还调皮，我就来找你！",

	["Dialogue4051102"]= "危害？长相可怖不就是最大的危害吗！",
	["Dialogue4051103"]= "……对不起我说实话，我非常害怕漂浮虫的样子。但要是让罗德尼队长知道的话……",

	["Dialogue4051202"]= "虽然不知道下次它们什么时候再来，不过既然有冒险者在，就不会再有问题了！",
	["Dialogue4051301"]= "哈哈哈，真是看不出来，你们这些冒险者也有两把刷子嘛！",
	["Dialogue4051302"]= "好！原本以为冒险者都是些不靠谱的家伙，没想到也有你这样的人嘛！以后就交给你们咯！",
	["Dialogue4051401"]= "啊……这沁人心脾的宁静……这才是我正在寻找的迷藏森林！……",

	["Dialogue4051503"]= "（好像非常愤怒的样子，先离开吧）",
	["Dialogue4051601"]= "哼，这种事情还是冒险者比较靠谱。王国军那些家伙都要看克罗涅卡那个老……的意见不肯帮忙。之后还会来找你的， 毕竟那是一群“益虫”嘛。",
	["Dialogue4051701"]= "看不到那些毛茸茸的腿，感觉心情都舒畅了不少呢，嘿嘿。你真是太可靠了！",
	["Dialogue4051801"]= "虽然短期内还看不到什么成效……迷藏森林会记住你的贡献的！非常感谢！",
	["Dialogue4051901"]= "陷入了苦战？哈哈哈哈，真是太好了。自然界居然有如此神奇的素材，接下来要委托什么样的冒险者去进行测试呢……",
	["Dialogue4052001"]= "非常，我们会在此处持续驻守到情况好转。如果有需要，我们还会请求你的协助。",
	["Dialogue4052101"]= "清理得差不多了？……不对不对，那些土拨鼠狡猾的很，可不会就这样善罢甘休。我们还不能放松警惕！",
	["Dialogue4052201"]= "奥丁在上，感谢你的协助。过去千年里，太多的人倒在了矿场中探索新资源的道路上，我们任重而道远啊……",
	["Dialogue4052301"]= "最近从以前的同僚那边收到了信，听说你在遇难船上非常活跃！看来拜托你的是对的，哈哈哈！",
	["Dialogue4052401"]= "唔……战斗能力继承了水母的毒性和漂浮虫的无攻击性吗……这对于自然演化来说有点浪费啊，这是为什么呢……要再做一次调查吗……",
	["Dialogue4052402"]= "（沉迷在思考之中，还是不要打扰她了）",
	["Dialogue4052501"]= "不行啊……虽然你够强，但并不足够坚韧。希望你能好好修行自己的肉身，早日变得更加强大！",
	["Dialogue4052601"]= "这艘船上曾经都是忠于卢恩王国的勇士，现在却会变成这样，唉……就算是奥丁神，有时候也会有点不公平呢。",
	["Dialogue4052701"]= "愿奥丁保佑他们，在来世走上正途……",
	["Dialogue4052801"]= "非常感谢。但是我们并不知道蚁族们会如何回应我们。我们必须加强警惕，严阵以待！",
	["Dialogue4052901"]= "怎么样？是不是和我说的一样？",
	["Dialogue4052902"]= "哈哈哈，不过你至少完好无损地回来了，就说明你很强啦！",
	["Dialogue4053001"]= "……",
	["Dialogue4053002"]= "明明安静了，我为何如此烦躁……难道是因为我并不属于这里，我才是和弦中的错误音符……",
	["Dialogue4053003"]= "（好像在为一些奇怪的事情烦恼，先不管他了）",
	["Dialogue4053101"]= "很好，这样的话它们的扩张多少会受到一些影响。此外我们还需要想办法削减它们的战斗力，请关注其他委托！",
	["Dialogue4053201"]= "非常感谢，就在你刚刚驱逐巨石怪的时候，我已经指挥商团从适当的路线前进了。",
	["Dialogue4053202"]= "天平商团，使命必达。这是我们的风格，以后欢迎惠顾。",
	["Dialogue4053301"]= "很好，蚁族的部队已经陷入了混乱，暂时无法发起有效的进攻。感谢你为我们争取了足够的时间！",
	["Dialogue4053401"]= "黑蚁的溃败对它们产生了极大的打击！",
	["Dialogue4053402"]= "不，如果不打败蚁后，我们永远无法称之为获得胜利。但是以我们的能力，已经无法再深入一步了。接下来……它们会怎么做呢？",
	["Dialogue4053501"]= "愿它们能得到宁静……哎。",
	["Dialogue4053601"]= "哎……还有什么别的办法吗……",
	["Dialogue4053602"]= "只要法老的力量还在，那些士兵就不会死去，最多只会耗费一些把骨头拼起来的力量……看来还得再多试试！",
	["Dialogue4053701"]= "冒险者……告诉你个不幸的消息。",
	["Dialogue4053702"]= "消灭这些黑狐的人，它们身上的不详就会转嫁到这个人身上………………",
	["Dialogue4053703"]= "哈哈哈开玩笑的开玩笑的，冒险者你的表情好有意思。要是神啊鬼啊什么的真的存在的话，那奥丁一定会保佑我们的， 别在意别在意！",
	["Dialogue4053801"]= "嗯，看来传言真的属实……很好，哈哈哈。看来那些新来的弓箭手佣兵有合适的训练对象了！",
	["Dialogue4053901"]= "我，我一定会好好考虑怎么跟父亲谈一下要离开妙勒尼山脉的事情……",
	["Dialogue4053902"]= "每天这样子对心脏实在是太不友好了o(╥﹏╥)o",
	["Dialogue4054001"]= "真是不可思议的描述……看来这些资料还远远不够。为了探索它们的魔法，我们还需要来自更多冒险者，从各个角度进行的记录。",
	["Dialogue4054101"]= "这些是非常珍贵的资料，一定会起到非常大的作用。非常感谢你的贡献，冒险者！",
	["Dialogue4054201"]= "哈哈，冒险者，最近埃尔森船队的水手们可对你赞不绝口啊，还有人给你起名号为水母杀手呢！",
	["Dialogue4054202"]= "水母这小东西，虽然看上去很可爱，但每年都会给艾尔贝塔带来重大损失。我们的委托会长期开放，以后有兴趣可以再来参加！",
	["Dialogue4054301"]= "愿他们来世不再遇到如此暴君，安稳度过一生……",
	["Dialogue4054401"]= "哈哈哈，过瘾！那些剑鱼平时耀武扬威的，现在就跟焉了似的。以后它们要是还敢乱来，我就来找你！",
	["Dialogue4054501"]= "愿他们来世不再遇到如此暴君，安稳度过一生……",
	["Dialogue4054601"]= "人类真是残忍的生物……一旦和宠物们接触的越多，我就会有这样的感受。希望大家都能善待动物吧……",
	["Dialogue4054701"]= "哼，他们终于到了他们该去的地方。",
	["Dialogue4054702"]= "同情？不，这是他们罪有应得，我永远不会对他们有任何的同情。",
	["Dialogue4054801"]= "唔……这种战斗的方式，和史籍中幼年龙族有点类似。这点印证了我的猜想。",
	["Dialogue4054802"]= "但是想要接近真相的话，还需要更多的记载。谢谢你，冒险者，你为我验证了一件关键的事情。",
	["Dialogue4054901"]= "这些都只是传说，实际上蛇女伊丝没有这样的能力吗……明白了，我们会收集来自更多来源的情报，毕竟也不能排除冒险者你运气很好的可能性……",
	["Dialogue4055001"]= "幼年体巴风特？太好了……虽然他们在幼年体实力也非常强悍，但至少还在控制之下。",
	["Dialogue4055002"]= "我会继续追踪他们的情报！虽然很害怕，但是魔物学者的研究成果就是为了拯救他人的！下次也来帮助我打探情况吧，谢谢啦！",
	["Dialogue4055101"]= "嗯？……啊，谢谢，请不要打扰我的研究……下次还会拜托你的。",
	["Dialogue4055201"]= "最近人鱼们可算是收敛了很多……咳咳，就是有个不好的消息。",
	["Dialogue4055202"]= "好像有更多想要挑战你的人鱼们在找你，现在你可是她们中间的名人啊，哈哈哈，抱歉咯！你接下来的日子看来要过的不怎么太平了。",
	["Dialogue4055301"]= "哎……情况完全没有好转。那些马克捍卫领地的坚定远远超出了我的预料。只能慢慢地进行拉锯战了。",
	["Dialogue4055302"]= "这大概会是场很长很长的战斗，以后我们一定会有合作机会的~",
	["Dialogue4055401"]= "狄奥斯性情暴烈，宁死不屈，一个都抓不回来？……难道我的愿望就要到此为止吗……",
	["Dialogue4055402"]= "……不行，我不会放弃的，我一定要找到和当年那只一样可爱温顺的狄奥斯！",
	["Dialogue4100101"]= "唉~最近新生太多，教学用的调和汁液又用完了呢~真是让人困扰！",
	["Dialogue4100102"]= "诶？可以吗？谢谢你！你真是个可靠的冒险者！普隆德拉郊外的曼陀罗魔花身上，它们的花液是最好的调和汁液！",
	["Dialogue4100201"]= "树精的生物学结构和普通的树到底有什么不一样呢……真是让人好奇。",
	["Dialogue4100202"]= "热心的冒险者！我需要它们的身体！哈哈，别被吓到了，我只需要它们身上一些边边角角的树枝而已！",
	["Dialogue4100301"]= "唔……要修理这些毛刷，这点材料远远不够啊……啊！冒险者，今天我们有点忙……",
	["Dialogue4100302"]= "啊啊，原来是你啊！我们现在急需小野猪的鬃毛！制作和修理毛刷的话，这是最好的材料了！",
	["Dialogue4100401"]= "这样做会不会有点残忍呢……",
	["Dialogue4100402"]= "哦哦！对啊，只要是你们冒险者去做的话……",
	["Dialogue4100403"]= "咳咳，我需要迷藏森林里那些森灵头上的草芽！",
	["Dialogue4100404"]= "不用担心，这些草哪怕折断了，也很快就会再长出来的。放心，把这些草芽做成料理之后，我会给你留一些的！",
	["Dialogue4100501"]= "你好，冒险者。我和沃尓玛斯主教的风格不太一样，希望你能见谅。",
	["Dialogue4100502"]= "根据我们的研究，魔菇的毒液中含有一种非常有效的解毒元素，希望你能去小心地收集一些过来，大圣堂将会给你优厚的报酬。",
	["Dialogue4100503"]= "千万不要自己成了受害者，给大圣堂添了麻烦。",
	["Dialogue4100601"]= "如果蓝疯兔皮毛不行的话，沙漠幼狼的皮毛也可以凑合一下吧……",
	["Dialogue4100602"]= "请为我收集一些蓝……不对，沙漠幼狼的皮毛吧！",
	["Dialogue4100603"]= "不，请不用在意。那虽然是我的追求，但我不会为了它而让别人陷入险境。沙漠幼狼的皮毛就可以了，拜托你了！",
	["Dialogue4100701"]= "克瑞米的蜂蜜……真怀念它生吃的味道……",
	["Dialogue4100702"]= "哦哦！来的正好。你现在将要去寻找这片大陆最伟大的甜食！克瑞米的蜂蜜！",
	["Dialogue4100703"]= "刚刚从克瑞米身体里收集的蜂蜜，散发出来的迷人香气……是我美食家多宾一生中最完美的体验！来吧，协助我一起见证吧！",
	["Dialogue4100801"]= "完蛋了……要是书里写的是真的的话……",
	["Dialogue4100802"]= "快，快帮帮我，如果再不管它们的话，世界就要毁灭了！",
	["Dialogue4100803"]= "那些松鼠手中的松果！要是它们在巢穴中藏了太多的松果，就会导致地面开裂，大陆漂移，人类灭亡……总之，不能放过它们！",
	["Dialogue4100901"]= "那些叶子中蕴含的神秘魔力……真是让人好奇喵……",
	["Dialogue4100902"]= "喵，喵！？还记得我在委托板上写的喵？拒绝回答任何问题喵！只要把狸猫头上的叶子带给我就可以了喵！",
	["Dialogue4101001"]= "这，这简直太不合理了……",
	["Dialogue4101002"]= "这简直是生物学的奇迹！原本生活在大陆北部的雪熊，居然长途迁移到了迷藏森林！",
	["Dialogue4101003"]= "请给我带来它们的毛发！我要亲眼看到证据！",
	["Dialogue4101101"]= "你知道挖矿这个领域，最擅长的种族是谁吗？",
	["Dialogue4101102"]= "答对了！据说基尔瑟们人手带着一本它们自己秘传的挖矿秘籍，从来不会传给人类。",
	["Dialogue4101103"]= "嘿嘿嘿……冒险者，要不然你……",
	["Dialogue4101201"]= "海葵的触手做成菜，是海神祭典的最佳祭品——这种事情不知道是哪个鬼提出来的，反正大家就信了。反正老子是不信这种恶心的东西海神会稀罕。",
	["Dialogue4101202"]= "不过那也没办法，拳头大的说了算。帮老子去收集一些海葵触手过来吧，剩下的老子自己去想办法。",

	["Dialogue4101501"]= "嗯？是你啊，大圣堂对你的评价非常高，希望你这次也能达到我的期望。",
	["Dialogue4101502"]= "根据我们上次对魔菇毒液的研究，成功提取出来了一种毒素。我们认为这种毒素在毒蛇的蛇胆中会大量存在，所以这次我需要你给我带来蛇胆。",
	["Dialogue4101503"]= "对了，不要在意我上次的话，你哪怕中了毒，大圣堂也会全力救治你的。",
	["Dialogue4101601"]= "天啊……这种神奇的生物……真想知道它身体内的秘密！",
	["Dialogue4101602"]= "麦斯特！它的组成方式完全不同于我往常的认知！它身体里的黑暗结晶一定就是组成身体的核心！请把那个带给我！",
	["Dialogue4101603"]= "嗯……接下来是要去请教绮斯克莉因小姐，还是诺顿老师呢……",
	["Dialogue4101701"]= "我……我到底要怎么办……",
	["Dialogue4101702"]= "冒险者，如果死亡和实现理想摆在你面前，各自有百分之五十的机会会发生，你会怎么选？",
	["Dialogue4101703"]= "你说得对……这个理想，值得我用生命来冒险！拜托你了冒险者，请为我收集蝎毒吧！",
	["Dialogue4101801"]= "冒险者，你觉得魔锅蛋是一种人工产物吗？",
	["Dialogue4101802"]= "到底是什么样的人，才会干出把鸡蛋煎好，然后连蛋带锅子一起做成魔法生物？这样伟大的厨师，他心里到底装的是什么？",

	["Dialogue4101904"]= "谢谢……",
	["Dialogue4102001"]= "木乃伊的制作流程非常的传奇，但是制作这些绷带的方法，至今也没有被破解。但是这些一定难不倒我！",
	["Dialogue4102002"]= "上次用来研究的绷带用完了。冒险者，再帮我带一些木乃伊的布片回来吧！",
	["Dialogue4102101"]= "自从经历了蝎毒的洗礼之后，我发现我获得了新生！现在的我无所畏惧！",
	["Dialogue4102102"]= "艾尔贝塔的渔民从来不会捞到来自海底深处的巨型螃蟹。它们身上的肉也会和浅水蟹一样好吃吗？真是让人期待！",
	["Dialogue4102103"]= "请给我带来一些深海蟹肉吧！我会给你丰厚的报酬的！",
	["Dialogue4102201"]= "你知道吗，传说中自然界最硬的东西是什么？",
	["Dialogue4102202"]= "是卡纳多斯的壳！据说卡纳多斯的壳足以抵挡最有穿透力的大锤！我现在手上正好有一些需要测试的样品，请帮我测试一下它们能不能打破卡纳多斯的壳！",
	["Dialogue4102203"]= "这样的话，就能证明我锻造大锤的能力了！",
	["Dialogue4102301"]= "毕帝特飞龙的进化可真是个世纪谜题……",
	["Dialogue4102302"]= "嗯？克罗涅卡大贤者也在研究毕帝特龙族吗？我没有他那么高深的目标啦，我只是想探究为什么拥有同样的先祖，毕帝特龙却在同一个地方进化出飞龙和地龙两个物种……",
	["Dialogue4102303"]= "正好最近我留着用来研究的飞龙翅膀也消耗完了。再帮我去收集一些吧，我感觉我离成功已经不远了……",
	["Dialogue4102401"]= "即使是阻碍我研究的魔物，也会有些让我尊敬的存在。",
	["Dialogue4102402"]= "安毕斯。据说它们是法老的忠实护卫，原本可以安享富贵，却在正值青壮年时自愿给法老陪葬……",

	["Dialogue4102501"]= "你有没有曾经对一些外形奇怪的东西产生食欲？",
	["Dialogue4102502"]= "真是太年轻了！往往这些东西，就是因为要保护自己不被吃掉，才故意长成那个鬼样子的，比如那个异变鱼……",
	["Dialogue4102503"]= "不，我要的是异常中的异常——异变鱼鳍！这是我作为资深美食家的直觉！去吧！",
	["Dialogue4102601"]= "你说，我的大锤和米洛斯的大锤，哪个更坚硬啊？",
	["Dialogue4102602"]= "哈哈哈，我也这么想。用点办法去收集些锤子的碎片回来！我倒是想亲眼见见古埃及的手艺！",
	["Dialogue4102701"]= "那天港口的那些家伙跟我说，他们写字都用海里墨鱼的墨水……我不信！哪有天然的东西比人工制作的更好的！请帮我收集一些吧！",
	["Dialogue4102702"]= "对了，虽然我不太相信，但还是给你个忠告。传说那些墨水只要沾上了，三个月都洗不掉！你在战斗的时候小心点哦！",
	["Dialogue4200101"]= "我那个蠢货徒弟，带着一把钓鱼竿出去，就以为自己出师了。哼，让他出去历练历练也好，免得坐井观天。",
	["Dialogue4200102"]= "帮我带点吃的给他。我年轻的时候出去历练，疲劳的时候就喜欢嚼蚯蚓干。",
	["Dialogue4200103"]= "是啊，那小子现在在伊斯鲁德岛，一定也很迷茫很疲惫。这时候收到师傅的秘传宝藏，就当是给他加个油，鼓鼓劲吧。",
	["Dialogue4200201"]= "唉……我每周都会给我的女儿写信，但是从来都没有收到过她的回信。她还是没有原谅我吗……",
	["Dialogue4200202"]= "她是这座农场的唯一继承人，却想着去普隆德拉当一个魔物学者。我们大吵了一架，也没能阻止她自己收拾行李，离家出走去克里图拉学院……",
	["Dialogue4200203"]= "拜托你了，听说她现在已经在普隆德拉成为了一个很优秀的魔物学者。现在的我想要尊重她的愿望，只是想让她能原谅我……就把这封信交给她吧。",
	["Dialogue4200301"]= "唉……要怎么才能获得多宾前辈的认同呢？",
	["Dialogue4200302"]= "冒险者，你有偶像吗？",
	["Dialogue4200303"]= "和偶像并肩作战，一起向着耀眼的那个目标奔跑……这就是我的梦想。但是多宾前辈他总是凶巴巴地拒绝我，也不让其他人告诉我原因。",
	["Dialogue4200304"]= "拜托了，请让我知道多宾前辈拒绝我的原因吧！",
	["Dialogue4200401"]= "哎……你说为什么会有人那么蠢……",
	["Dialogue4200402"]= "冒险者，委托板上的消息你也看到了，你不会介意破坏一个少女的梦……不对，幻想吧？",
	["Dialogue4200403"]= "好。你知道伊斯鲁德岛花园中央的那座喷泉吗？不知道从什么时候起，那里就被称作是求缘之泉。只要在那里许愿，所有和姻缘相关的愿望都会得到实现。",
	["Dialogue4200404"]= "我的好友梅娜……她沉浸在这个都市传说中不可自拔，每天都会在那里，幻想着那个人。",
	["Dialogue4200405"]= "我有那个人已经再也不会回来的证据，但是我不希望我来打破她的幻想。请你把这个包裹交给她，她只要看了里面的内容，就会明白了。",
	["Dialogue4200501"]= "冒险者！事情十万火急！",
	["Dialogue4200502"]= "根据我最近从书本上了解到的情况，世界将会毁灭！",
	["Dialogue4200503"]= "我需要赶紧从图书馆里找到这本书的下册！请快去伊斯鲁德岛问图书管理员把下册带过来吧！书单给你！",
	["Dialogue4200601"]= "报告在这里，请将它交给魔物学者柏莎·格雷。报告内容涉及到重要的魔物毒性治疗方案，请务必准确送到。",
	["Dialogue4200701"]= "我们与在金字塔内工作的同僚们的沟通非常不顺利，最近甚至被魔物阻断了补给线。",
	["Dialogue4200702"]= "冒险者，请帮助我们将基础物资运输到金字塔内的同僚那里吧。他的名字叫库拉罗，特征的话……总之你看到人类应该马上就能认出他来吧。",
	["Dialogue4200801"]= "嘿嘿，冒险者你运气真是不错！你知道吗？玫瑰红酒馆和沙漠绿酒馆食谱共享之后，各自调制出了更多的美味特饮呢！",
	["Dialogue4200802"]= "这次的食谱是……嗯……对，这个！请好好地交给希芙里妹妹，我相信它一定会成为沙漠爆款的！",
	["Dialogue4200901"]= "啊~冒险者，卡普拉商团竭诚为您服务~您这是……接受委托的冒险者对吧！",
	["Dialogue4200902"]= "是这样的，最近敝社与梦罗克分部的联络由于魔物活跃的原因，有些困难。请冒险家协助卡普拉商团，为梦罗克分部的负责人泰依琳小姐送去文书吧！",
	["Dialogue4201001"]= "艾尔贝塔，这座美丽的海港城市，将会是我最后的归宿吗……",
	["Dialogue4201002"]= "冒险者，你可知道被一朵极美的花儿所吸引的感受吗？那飘逸的黑色长发，温暖和亲和的笑容。她的瞳孔中如此的清澈而纯真……",
	["Dialogue4201003"]= "不行，哪怕她拒绝我，我也不会放弃！我正在给她谱写最优美的篇章……在这之前，请你帮助我将这份情书带给她吧！",
	["Dialogue4201101"]= "啊啊！那家伙又不知道去那里偷懒了！气死我了！",
	["Dialogue4201102"]= "没错！我哪养得起偷懒的家伙！冒险者，你的话……去吧帕斯卡那家伙叫回来吧。",
	["Dialogue4201103"]= "他要是不在干活，一定就在酒吧街那里。你……就告诉他，老大很生气，赶紧偷偷溜回去就可以了。",
	["Dialogue4201104"]= "帕斯卡那家伙……算了，都是些陈年往事。总之你需要通知他，让他自己回去就好了。",
	["Dialogue4201201"]= "你们冒险者，应该都认识卡鲁船长吧？",
	["Dialogue4201202"]= "那太好了。这封信，希望你能交给马可。",
	["Dialogue4201203"]= "还有……嗯，如果可以的话，请把马可的答复告诉我。",
	["Dialogue4250101"]= "师傅的包裹？……啊啊啊！蚯蚓！这一定是师傅给我的引导！看这精美的包装，一定是上好的鱼饵吧！",
	["Dialogue4250102"]= "谢谢你，冒险者！有空的话请帮我给师傅带一声感谢！我一定会用师傅给的鱼饵钓上最大的鱼的！",
	["Dialogue4250201"]= "你好，我就是柏莎·格雷。请问……",
	["Dialogue4250202"]= "信？……哎，果然还是这样。",
	["Dialogue4250203"]= "我还不能回去。没有在目前的研究中实现突破，我回去也没有意义。",
	["Dialogue4250204"]= "绿棉农场从以绿棉虫为友，到成为绿棉虫的敌人。搞清楚中间到底发生了什么事，就是我来到这里的目的。",
	["Dialogue4250205"]= "父亲他哪怕知道这件事……也不会有什么改变的。对于他而言，治理虫害才是正确的道路。谢谢你为我带来这个消息，但是我的想法是不会改变的。",
	["Dialogue4250301"]= "佩里妮派来的？",
	["Dialogue4250302"]= "像你这样的冒险家，一周没个十个也有八个。每次还得跟你们解释一遍，我都快把这套台词给背下来了！",
	["Dialogue4250303"]= "你知道我和佩里妮的职业是什么吗？是美食家。",
	["Dialogue4250304"]= "美食家可不是和你们想象的一样，是一个每天躺着品尝美食的职业。真正的开拓者，是要在无数恶心的，甚至是有毒的东西里，发现前人从未发现过的美食。",
	["Dialogue4250305"]= "我不想让佩里妮因为向往我的目标，所以才追随我。这是一种非常危险的职业。",
	["Dialogue4250306"]= "按佩里妮的性格，知道了也只会更坚定她的决心吧……我不会强求你保密，但是我希望你能明白我的想法。",
	["Dialogue4250401"]= "你好，冒险者！你也是来这里请求姻缘的吗？",
	["Dialogue4250402"]= "我啊，每天会在这里，祈祷着他能早日归来……对了对了，他在出海之前，可是跟我约定好，等他归来的时候，我们就会在这座花园里结婚！",
	["Dialogue4250403"]= "他一定会遵守我们的约定，所以我一定会在这里等他。这和这座泉水其实没什么关系，只是因为，这里是我们约定好的地方……",
	["Dialogue4250404"]= "嗯？这个包裹是……把这个包裹交给雪莉？好的，交给我吧~虽然雪莉天天骂我痴心妄想，但是我知道她是为了我好，她还是我最好的朋友！",
	["Dialogue4250501"]= "嗯？这个字迹……又是克里昂那个家伙吗？",
	["Dialogue4250502"]= "他经常会沉浸在小说里的情节不可自拔，甚至还会当做是真的……就比如他会把松鼠当成是大陆开裂的最大罪魁祸首，我直到现在都不敢把《冰河时代》这本书后面的部分借给他。",
	["Dialogue4250503"]= "哎，这套书的话更不行了……主角最后被阴谋欺骗，帮助神毁灭了世界……不行不行，这要是让克里昂看到了还得了？",
	["Dialogue4250601"]= "信件已经确实地收到了！毕斯卡斯主教可真是一丝不苟呢……",
	["Dialogue4250701"]= "嗯？你找我吗？",
	["Dialogue4250702"]= "对，是我。这些是妮可那里来的物资？谢谢了，我还在忙，就不陪你聊了。",
	["Dialogue4250703"]= "（库拉罗先生……的确是非常具有个人特征的人啊）",
	["Dialogue4250801"]= "这就是大姐的食谱……唔……原来还能这样……口感处理的话……原来如此！真不愧是她！",
	["Dialogue4250802"]= "哈哈，对不起对不起，一时间看入迷了。非常感谢你的协助，以后欢迎光临哦~",
	["Dialogue4250901"]= "卡普拉商团会在这飞沙之中为您提供完美的服务！……嗯？文书？非常感谢，冒险家。",
	["Dialogue4251001"]= "嗨！我是艾尔贝塔分部卡普拉绣灵！请好好享受这座海港都市的风情吧！",
	["Dialogue4251002"]= "咦？那封信……啊~是卡西亚斯先生对吧。真是伤脑筋呢。",
	["Dialogue4251003"]= "是的，我希望的爱情，是能够大胆地在我面前表现出来的！这样的方式有点……哈哈哈，十分抱歉，对于卡普拉来说，有些词语不能使用呢。",
	["Dialogue4251004"]= "信我确实地收下了，谢谢你，冒险者。",
	["Dialogue4251101"]= "嗝……趁老大还没发现，再喝一杯……",
	["Dialogue4251102"]= "唔哦！都，都这个时间了！我得赶紧偷偷溜回去！谢谢你冒险家，万一被他发现了就完蛋了！",
	["Dialogue4251201"]= "埃尔森给老子的信？……那不用看了，随意处置这封信吧。",
	["Dialogue4251202"]= "他已经给我送了三个月的信了，写得都没什么区别。老子不会回埃尔森船队的……那些凶手。",
	["Dialogue4251203"]= "不关你事……让老子安静一下。",
	["Dialogue4300101"]= "热心的冒险者！你能代替我这个风烛残年的老人去给老友扫个墓吗，人一老，连以前每天走的路都动弹不得咯。",
	["Dialogue4300102"]= "他的墓地就在普隆德拉教堂的后边。我在他的墓前面种了一株他最喜欢的萤蓝蘑菇，现在应该长势正旺吧。",
	["Dialogue4300103"]= "找到它之后，请告诉他，老友今天身体有恙，来不了了。然后把它墓碑前的蘑菇带给我吧。",
	["Dialogue4300201"]= "花朵和女孩有很多相似之处，你不觉得吗？",
	["Dialogue4300202"]= "比如美丽动人，娇嫩欲滴，令人心生呵护的情感……就好像这些歌迷们。我想用美丽的牵牛花答谢她们的支持，请你帮忙去西门那边的高地附近，摘一些最美丽的花朵给我吧。",
	["Dialogue4300301"]= "来了吗，这次的货物非常的娇嫩，一定要小心运输！",
	["Dialogue4300302"]= "看到那边地上的紫色花朵了吗。你要负责小心地把它铲起来，送到普隆德拉图书馆的诺顿那里。",
	["Dialogue4300303"]= "看他们一副着急的样子，应该是非常重要的东西。请务必小心！",
	["Dialogue4300401"]= "唔……我到底差在哪里……为什么一直不能像师傅一样钓到鱼呢？",
	["Dialogue4300402"]= "没错！一定是因为鱼饵的问题！",
	["Dialogue4300403"]= "师傅的鱼饵，用的是他帐篷旁的红色蘑菇。虽然不知道那是什么，但一定隐藏着什么惊天大秘密！",
	["Dialogue4300404"]= "冒险者，师傅的帐篷就在南门外，帮我去摘一株过来让我研究一下吧！拜托了！",
	["Dialogue4300501"]= "不知道咕咕伊现在怎么样……吃的好不好……",
	["Dialogue4300502"]= "啊，你好，咕咕伊是我亲手培养长大的大嘴鸟，最近会被交付给骑士冒险者，没想到它却突然不见了踪影……",
	["Dialogue4300503"]= "它平时最爱吃南瓜了，我猜它是跑到南门外的农场去了！请把它带回来吧！",
	["Dialogue4300601"]= "冒险者好久不见！看到你变得那么可靠真是让人高兴！",
	["Dialogue4300602"]= "说来惭愧，乐园团有一个装满食物的背包被乌鸦给叼到它们的巢穴去了。我们这里没有人能爬上那个悬崖……",
	["Dialogue4300603"]= "哈哈，真可靠，那就拜托你了！",
	["Dialogue4300701"]= "真是伤脑筋，如果信鸽找不到我们这里的话，我们就没有办法和普隆德拉的本部联络了。",
	["Dialogue4300702"]= "我们为了驻守蚂蚁密穴，临时修改了驻扎地点。本部派来的信鸽并没有收到这个指令，所以大概还停留在它们原先预计停留的地方。",
	["Dialogue4300703"]= "请帮助我们去信鸽身上把总部的命令取来吧。",
	["Dialogue4300801"]= "不知道它现在过的怎么样……",
	["Dialogue4300802"]= "儿子？不不不，是我的得意之作。我还在苏克拉特沙漠工作的时候，用最好的木头制作了一块永不损坏的路牌。",
	["Dialogue4300803"]= "现在闲下来了，就非常担心，那块路牌现在怎么样了。但是我一把老骨头了，让我再跑趟沙漠，身子骨可受不了。",
	["Dialogue4300804"]= "冒险者，你能帮我去看一下吗？它就竖在沙漠绿洲的附近。",
	["Dialogue4300901"]= "冒险家吗？得救了得救了~我们现在缺少人手，请你马上帮我们一个小忙吧~",
	["Dialogue4300902"]= "我们酒吧建筑的后面有一棵仙人掌，请帮忙去切一点下来，这可是我们为了制作仙人掌特饮亲手种植的魔法仙人掌哦！",
	["Dialogue4301001"]= "你知道有一种会偷东西的黑色小鸟吗？",
	["Dialogue4301002"]= "对！就是那种可恶的鸟！它们最近在艾尔贝塔出现，专门瞄准商人和贵妇人的珍贵珠宝下手。",
	["Dialogue4301003"]= "艾尔贝塔以前从来没有出现过乌鸦，大家都苦不堪言。据说乌鸦的巢穴就在城内的某个角落，请把我们的失物找回来吧！",
	["Dialogue4301101"]= "唔……不错，你看上去还比较靠谱！之前我委托的冒险家，总会给我私藏几根竹笋，你不会这么干吧？",
	["Dialogue4301102"]= "可以！我在斐扬南部地区的森林里种了点竹笋，就在艾尔贝塔大门出去附近。最近那边魔物泛滥，竹笋都被糟蹋了。冒险者你看要是还能抢救一下的话，就帮我收割点竹笋回来吧！",
	["Dialogue4301201"]= "如果一件衣服能同时拥有华美的外表和迷人的香气，那该多棒啊！",
	["Dialogue4301202"]= "万事俱备，只缺香气的来源了。产自海底洞窟的玛格丽特花是世界上最完美的香料。冒险者，你有勇气去海底一探究竟吗？",
	["Dialogue4301203"]= "太棒了！玛格丽特花的形状非常奇特，像是两根触须一般，但它的香气可骗不了人！你一定能认得出来！",
	["Dialogue4350101"]= "哈哈，就是这个蘑菇。谢谢你，热心的冒险者。",
	["Dialogue4350102"]= "不知道我还能再活多久……说不定以后也只能拜托冒险者去扫墓了。哈哈哈，真是岁月不饶人啊。",
	["Dialogue4350201"]= "谢谢你，冒险者，这些花朵完全配得上她们的美貌。那么……",
	["Dialogue4350202"]= "这朵怒放的花，最适合你那成熟曼妙的身姿。",
	["Dialogue4350203"]= "呵呵，谢谢你~",
	["Dialogue4350204"]= "这朵含苞待放的花，适合你青春靓丽的气质。",
	["Dialogue4350205"]= "谢谢你~喜欢你果然是个正确的决定~！",
	["Dialogue4350206"]= "这朵还未开放的花骨朵，适合你凛冽的风度。待它开放时，一定也会非常灿烂。",
	["Dialogue4350207"]= "……谢谢",
	["Dialogue4350208"]= "那么这朵还没有成熟的小花朵，当然就适合这么可爱的小女孩啦！",
	["Dialogue4350209"]= "谢谢你！摩尔托斯哥哥！",
	["Dialogue4350301"]= "喔喔！这就是实验品吗……",
	["Dialogue4350302"]= "咳，咳咳，请不要在意。来，快把它给我吧。",
	["Dialogue4350401"]= "唔……嗯……",
	["Dialogue4350402"]= "这个……不是普通的蘑菇吗？秘诀真的是它吗……真的不是我搞错了吗……还是我有哪里看漏了……",
	["Dialogue4350403"]= "（他陷入了沉思，还是不打扰他了）",
	["Dialogue4350501"]= "啊！咕咕伊！你平安无事啊！",
	["Dialogue4350502"]= "咕伊！咕咕！咕咕伊！！！！！",
	["Dialogue4350503"]= "它说……它不想离开我。这个我当然知道……毕竟我也不想离开它。",
	["Dialogue4350504"]= "但是这就是大嘴鸟管理员的职责，驯养大嘴鸟，并把它们交给冒险者。",
	["Dialogue4350505"]= "这并不是第一只咕咕伊。我给每只我驯养的大嘴鸟都会起这个名字，为了能假装自己一直在照顾同一只。毕竟……和它们离别也不是件很好受的事情。",
	["Dialogue4350506"]= "谢谢你，冒险者。",
	["Dialogue4350601"]= "嗯？被丢在了悬崖下面？……好像东西什么都没少，看来那些乌鸦对这些东西没兴趣。毕竟这可是要分给来游乐园玩的孩子们的零食，怎么被那些可恶的乌鸦抢走！",
	["Dialogue4350701"]= "非常感谢。在我们重新指派新的信鸽之前，应该会一直需要冒险者的协助，请关注委托板上我们的委托，感谢。",
	["Dialogue4350801"]= "一切完好？喔呵呵呵，真不愧是我当年耗费心血的作品！这样的话我就放心了！",
	["Dialogue4350901"]= "谢谢你帮了大忙！我们这里都在忙，就不客套啦！",
	["Dialogue4351001"]= "太好了，虽然东西被偷走了，但并没有损坏。但是乌鸦没有被抓住，就说明这种事情以后还会发生。哎，真是多灾多难啊……",
	["Dialogue4351101"]= "只剩一根了？？？该死！这些可恶的魔物！看来得想办法严加看管了……",
	["Dialogue4351201"]= "没错，就是这个……玛格丽特之纱，已经失传的技艺，看来就要在我手里重生了！不管失败多少次，我也要完成师傅的遗愿！",

This past day is definitely the darkest month since he took over his father’s clothes and became the director of the Green Cotton Ranch. \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> Green Cotton Ranch, as its name suggests, is a pasture that raises Fabres. Fabres are temperate and spit silk is an important raw material for Prontera silk, so in the past few hundred years, green cotton pasture has always been an important raw material source in the Kingdom of Lun. \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> But at the moment when the purchaser keeps collecting it, Klaus has nothing to do with it. The important reason is that the Fabre strikes! The docile green cotton Thief Bug, it actually went on strike! \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> He remembered Bertha, the Little Girl who said to him that 'green cotton worms are our friends and can't enslave them.' I heard that she became a Mage after graduating from the Kretula College. Her research on the Fabres is famous in the kingdom. If it's you, you should know what to do... Klaus helplessly smiles, remembering the last sentence she left before leaving this small life pasture: I don't want to go back to this abominable place of slavery Fabres ! \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> At this time, Bertha is not far from the Prontera South Gate. With her knowledge of green cotton worms, this can only happen if they are hungry. She does not believe that the Green Cotton Ranch will make such a low-level mistake. So she was anxious to pay attention to the situation of the green cotton pasture, but did not want to really help. She certainly remembers the last sentence before leaving. \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> The two of them are connected together, that is me. \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> I used the method given by Bertha to lead a giant Fabre - that is, this guy ate all the food that was originally given to the entire pasture, which led to other green cotton. The hunger of the Thief Bug. Since this problem is solved, the Green Cotton Ranch should be able to continue to function normally. Will they both be reconciled? I don't think so, the difference in philosophy is not so easy to solve. But I think maybe this is not bad, they are all in different ways to love the green cotton pasture.",
	["NpcStoryContent200021"] = "<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> What is music? Former Mortos believed that music is the carrier of love. The person who heard his voice felt as if he had seen love flowing as a note in the air. His music and appearance quickly captured a large number of women. He slowly became famous and became a popular idol, singing for everyone. He began to try to sing the sounds of everyone's favorite, the soul of his music is constantly passing. \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> When I met Motos for the first time outside Prontera South Gate, I seemed to see a standard idol - I would be tired of the idol aura, though I miss my lover, But he will not hesitate to hide the existence of lovers for his own career. \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> and his lover Poya?

She was with him when Motos was not famous, and when Motos was shining, she was willing to retreat into the shadows, just not to cover his light. Over time, the love of Mortos was distorted into hatred, and with the shackles of the girls around him turned into seeds of darkness, rooted in the heart of Paya, sprouted, and grew rapidly. She persuaded herself: 'How can Mortos really be true to those girls? He said that he has no love for the outside and only for acting careers!' But what is crazy inside is 'Mortos, why don't you focus on me?' Only I am truly in love with you!' Seven years of love is the old wife and wife in the eyes of many people, but there is no sense of security in the eyes of Boya. I believe... these things Mortos is completely unaware of, or is it selectively ignored? \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> Want to monopolize a person forever, what method would you use? Poya used one of the most extreme methods - lyricism. Her embarrassment to the girl around Mortos has reached a point where she is heartbroken and painful. For her, going to death with Mortos is the only relief. She wants to be with Formos forever - in another world. \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color>Moores decided to temporarily withdraw from the entertainment industry - this is a development I did not expect. \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color>Moores is not so contemptuous on his appearance, it is better to say that he is actually a very simple musician. What he lost was not the temptation of beauty or the right of fame, but the recognition of his music. Everyone likes my music, so I want to write music that everyone likes - he has been running with this idea, but he has no way of thinking about the feelings of people around him - especially Boya. \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> 'I want to retrieve the soul of my music.'\n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> 'I want to find my love with Boya.' \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> 'I want to find the lost me.' \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> Seeing Mortos’ firm eyes, I suddenly felt that Helping this person must be right.",

The legendary mermaid hates humans very much, but the music of Mortos has clearly won the recognition of mermaid. In the testimony of Poseidon, he sang a poem that was scored for Paya. This is a poem written for marriage, and Mortos gave up the idea of ​​marriage proposal after winning the blessing of Poseidon. \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> He doesn't think it is a good time to propose a marriage. He hopes that after he regains the voice of the soul of the former love, he introduces Poya in front of all the fans and then proposes to her in front of everyone - of course, this plan is only quietly told to me. But when I got a smile on the face of Boya in my eyes, I couldn't help guessing, is it that Poya can understand what Mortos expressed in the song at this time? \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> Right, there are some minor episodes. Before, I was a little concerned about the seemingly worn-out piano of Motos, which was originally made by Boya.

The arrival came a while. If the voice of Mortos is sung for love, then the piano that Bobaya gave him is probably the carrier of love. After the piano was destroyed, Mortos’s disappointment made me a little worried. This kind of problem is still given to them to slowly digest it, but I do not know why I still believe in Motos, if he has a pure heart that loves music, he must have a way out. \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> But he can sing the genius of the touching song by relying on the soul.",

Usually this is an important step on the road to greatness. Countless people will give up, but I think he will succeed, so he helped him catch a few vultures at his request. \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> What kind of creature is the eagle? From the growth period to experience the cruel test of survival, soaring in the sky without any existence can block them, can be described as the existence of incomparable freedom. Their anger stunned the clouds, and for a time I felt a bit chilly. However, Mortos is not moving, what is he comprehending? The answer was quickly revealed. \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color>Moores has been thinking about what the piano means to him. For the past, the piano is the soul of Paya, and if there is no piano sound, there is no soul. But until he saw the free eagle and felt the power of the eagle's voice through the sound, he realized it. \n<color=#FFFFFF00>1234</color> 'I want to use my voice to express my love for Poya! My voice is powerful!' Mortos is as happy as a child, and Poya Looking at his expression, it is a bit like a sister looking at his brother is generally gentle and tolerant.",

I am not going to be like this. The Poseidon said to me that no one is wrong. The mistake is that we are the people of the sea. Is this curse not from the Poseidon?
